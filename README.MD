# Caselaw repro

This repository serves as an appendix to our SIGIR submission. Notebooks used to generate results for the paper can be found in `notebooks`. TREC result files can be found in `run-files`.

## Retrieval and ranking code
See [language-model-retrieval repository](github.com/dan-locke/langauge-model-retrieval) for implementations of most methods. 

For BERT based rankers, we used Huggingface, and [KourosAI - NBoost TinyBert model](https://github.com/koursaros-ai/nboost).
